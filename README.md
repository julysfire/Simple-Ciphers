# Simple Ciphers App

## Sumamry
This app is made to teach about some basics ciphers including the Ceaser (ROT) Cipher, Atbash Cipher, Baconian Cipher, Vignere Cipher, Telephone Cipher (this is essentially just how texting used to be), and then a Hex/Decimal/Binary convert (while not a cipher, I thought to include it to show how it works).  Each cipher comes with a page that shows the cipher in action based on an input string or you could decode an encoded string.  A button is also present for easily copying to the clipboard.

In addition, each cipher's page also has an additional about page that explains the history of the cipher and how the cipher works.
